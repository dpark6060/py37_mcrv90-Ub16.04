# MSOT-mouse-recon

## Description
This gear is designed to run reconstrution on a MSOT mouse image.  It requires at least 2.5 gb of memory to run on a 75mb file.  It takes approximately 6 minutes to run. This gear uses a precomputed model matrix with the input data.  

Current model matrix:

`A_mat_t_res_2_200x200_c1530_width20.mat`

#### TODO: Maybe they'll want to be able to change this in the future?

### Inputs

There are two required inputs for this gear:

1. MSOT file
  - The MSOT file of the data to be converted.  This is a small metadata/header file with information on the actual scan.
2. bin file
  - the BIN file of the data to be converted.  This is a larger binary file containing the true image data.
  
File names must be identical, save for the extension.

**example: **: `Subject_01.msot` and `Subject_01.bin`

#### TODO: Set file names identical in the gear regardless of input name

### Output:

There is only one output for this gear:  A matlab .mat file

#### TODO: Naming convention for this is currently unknown.  Should check for name conflict potential.
